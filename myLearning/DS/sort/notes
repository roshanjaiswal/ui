Tim Sort
---------------
The fastest sorting algorithm you've never heard of.
-- Tim sort is fasted algorith in python.
Timsort (derived from merge sort and insertion sort) was introduced in 2002 and 
    while slower than quicksort for random data, Timsort performs better on ordered data.


Quad Sort
-----------------
Quadsort (derived from merge sort) was introduced in 2020 and is faster than quicksort for random data, 
    and slightly faster than Timsort on ordered data.


Quick Sort 
---------------
Quick sort is better suited for large data sets. 
It is the fastest and efficient algorithm for large sets of data.
But it is inefficient if the elements in the list are already sorted which results 
    in the worst case time complexity of O(n2).
